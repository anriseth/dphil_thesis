Each of
\Cref{ch:onestage,ch:discrete_control,ch:cts_control,ch:objaccel}
contain original work.  The comparison of decisions from different
decision-making models in \Cref{ch:onestage} has not been conducted in
the revenue management community, and the multiobjective optimisation
package is written by me.  The dynamic pricing problem in
\Cref{ch:discrete_control,ch:cts_control} use a different combination
of demand models, constraints, and profit functions than the existing
literature.  The investigation of the impact the optimal and
suboptimal pricing policies have on the profit distribution in these
chapters is more extensive than the marginalised comparisons that are
usually conducted. The solution and the asymptotic analysis of the HJB
equations in \Cref{ch:cts_control} are original.  The optimisation
algorithm in \Cref{ch:objaccel} is an improvement of an existing idea,
but the theory and numerical tests are all original.

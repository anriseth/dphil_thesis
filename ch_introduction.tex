\chapter{Introduction}
This doctoral thesis presents a collection of topics that are relevant
in decision making under uncertainty, primarily motivated by
problems in the retail industry.
We will speak primarily about the decision process involved in setting the
price of products, including demand modelling, estimation from data,
handling of uncertainty, and optimization algorithms.

The process of pricing products in order to control demand and
maximize revenues has been undertaken for centuries. In recent
decades, data- and model-driven approaches have become increasingly
popular in order to advise on and automate the process for companies.
There are several success stories from early adopters, for example in
the airline industry.
American Airlines estimated in 1992 that the introduction of revenue
management software had, over the preceding three
years, contributed \SI{500}[\$] million of additional revenue per year,
and would continue to do so in the future~\cite{smith1992yield}.
In an example from Chilean retail, the authors of~\cite{bitran1998coordinating}
report an expected revenue improvement of \SIrange{7}{16}{\percent} after implementing
model-driven strategies.
This range of financial impact due to implementation of pricing and revenue
management systems are further supported in other studies, see \cite[Ch.~1.2]{phillips2005pricing}.
For retailers with billions of pounds in revenues, small
improvements to their revenue-management processes can be worth millions
of pounds.
In addition unsold items add up to thousands of tonnes of waste per year, so
improving the control of demand for products is advantageous
for both retailers and the environment.

The theory and practice of pricing and revenue management is highly
multi-disciplinary, and attracts research from a wide variety of
fields. Our focus will be on different aspects of the modelling and
optimization procedures, from a more mathematical point of view.
\citet{phillips2005pricing} and \citet{ozer2012oxford} contain perspectives on the
revenue management process prevalent in the social sciences.
A notable resource with more mathematical focus, which
cover both theoretical and practical
perspectives, is that of those of \citet{talluri2006theory}.
Other approaches to pricing of retail products more akin to the
mathematical modelling community can, for example, be found in~\cite{butler2014customer}.

\section{Outline of the thesis}
\textbf{TODO:} Just use the stuff in ``Making decisions'' below?

\section{Making decisions}
The approach to decision making considered in this thesis consists of
five general steps, of which each chapter will touch on a subset.
The steps are summarised as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Objective --- statement of what the decision maker wants to achieve.
\item Model of the system --- mathematical modelling of relevant aspects
  needed to achieve the objective.
\item Data assimilation --- incorporation of available observations in
  the mathematical model.
\item Risk preferences --- mathematical modelling of the decision makers risk
  preferences.
\item Optimization --- algorithms and approximations required to
  evaluate different decisions.
\end{enumerate}
In \Cref{ch:onestage} we focus on the general discussion of the
Objective, Risk preferences, and Optimization.
Following that, \Cref{ch:discrete_control} and
\Cref{ch:cts_control} discuss  aspects of the steps Model of the system, Risk
preferences, and Optimization.
These three chapters are closely linked to the application of pricing
in retail, whilst the remaining chapters have a mathematical focus
independent of particular application.
\Cref{ch:koopestim} looks at a novel way to handle the Data
assimilation step. Finally, \Cref{ch:objaccel} presents a new
algorithm to improve the Optimization step.\todo{Necessary?}


The objectives we focus on in this thesis are aspects
of sales, revenue, and profit targets that can be influenced by
pricing decisions.\todo{Move to section?}
At the core of such decisions lies models connecting price and demand of products.
In \Cref{sec:intro_model_demand} we summarise the classic approaches
to demand modelling in revenue management, for reference in later
chapters.
The demand models often include unobservable parameters that are
inferred from data.
These models are used to forecast future demand, sometimes months in
the future.
The uncertainty of future events, and estimates of model
parameters, will be described as random variables within a probability
theoretical framework. \Cref{sec:intro_prob_rvs} covers preliminary
theory of probability, random variables and stochastic
processes.\todo{Move to section?}

\section{Modelling demand}\label{sec:intro_model_demand}
We define demand as the quantity of a product that people are willing
to buy per time period, at a particular price. For the purpose of our
work, demand may change over time, even if the price is constant.
Time-dependent aspects of demand include periodic effects, such as
seasonality and longer term trends.
The relationship between price and demand are often described in a
continuum fashion, rather than at discrete levels such as pounds or
pence. We are interested in retailers with large-scale sales and
aggregate demand models where treating the demand as a continuum gives
a reasonable approximation.
In both academia and industry, simple demand curves often used to
model the price-demand relationship of
products. See~\cite[Ch.~7.3]{talluri2006theory} or~\cite{phillips2005pricing}
for a discussion of the most popular demand curves. They are often
chosen in order to simplify the parameter
estimation procedure, in practice, or simplify the analysis, for academic purposes.

We denote the demand for a given product at price $a\geq 0$, holding
other aspects such as time and competitor product prices constant, by $q(a)$.
This thesis will make use of a range of demand curves, in particular
\begin{align}\label{eq:demand_fun_lin}
  q(a) &= q^{(1)}-q^{(2)}a,&q^{(1)},q^{(2)}&>0,&\text{linear demand}&,\\
  q(a) &= e^{q^{(1)}-q^{(2)}a},&q^{(1)}\in\mathbb{R},q^{(2)}&>0,&\text{exponential
                                                                  demand}&\text{, and}\\
  q(a) &= q^{(1)}a^{-q^{(2)}},&q^{(1)},q^{(2)}&>0,&\text{power demand}&.\label{eq:demand_fun_pow}
\end{align}
Note that these functions can only be considered as local
approximations to demand. That is, we use these models to predict
aggregate demand responses in a neighborhood of the current
price. Care must especially be taken if one is to use the power demand
function: The demand goes to infinity as price goes to zero, and
revenues go to infinity as price goes to infinity for products with $q^{(2)}\in(0,1)$.
\Cref{fig:demandfun_comparison} provides a comparison of the three
demand curves, and shows that they behave very similarly close to the
current price, $a=1$.

      \addplot+[domain=0.5:1.5, mark=none] {exp(1-x)};
      \addlegendentry{Exponential}

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Comparison of demand curves. The units of price and time
    have been re-scaled so that $q(1)=1$.}\label{fig:demandfun_comparison}
\end{figure}

In cases where we believe that the price of one product affects the
demand of another product, we introduce cross-effects on the demand
functions. For products $j=1,2,\dots,J$, denote their respective prices by
$a=(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_J)$, and their demands by $q_j(a)$.
One way to extend the demand curves in~\eqref{eq:demand_fun_lin}
to~\eqref{eq:demand_fun_pow} to a multi-product case is, according to \cite{talluri2006theory},
\begin{align}
  q_j(a)&=q_{j}^{(1)}-\sum_{l=1}^Jq_{j,l}^{(2)}a_l,
  &\text{linear demand}&,\\
  q_j(a)&=\exp\left( q_{j}^{(1)}-\sum_{l=1}^Jq_{j,l}^{(2)}a_l
          \right),
  &\text{exponential demand}&\text{, and}\\
  q_j(a)&=q_j^{(1)}\prod_{l=1}^Ja_l^{-q_{j,l}^{(2)}},
  &\text{power demand}&.
\end{align}
The valid domains of the parameters vary. For example, a linear demand
model where we believe that increasing the price of product $l$ has a
positive effect on the demand of product $j$ constrains
$q_{j,l}^{(2)}$ to be negative. \Cref{fig:demand_exponential_two}
gives an example of demand for a given product, with one competing
product, using the exponential demand function.

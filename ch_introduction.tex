\chapter{Introduction}
This doctoral thesis presents a collection of topics that are relevant
in decision making under uncertainty, primarily motivated by
problems in the retail industry.
We will speak primarily about the decision process involved in setting the
price of products, including demand modelling, estimation from data,
handling of uncertainty, and optimization algorithms.

The process of pricing products in order to control demand and
maximize revenues has been undertaken for centuries. In recent
decades, data- and model-driven approaches have become increasingly
popular in order to advise on and automate the process for companies.
There are several success stories from early adopters, for example in
the airline industry.
American Airlines estimated in 1992 that the introduction of revenue
management software had, over the preceding three
years, contributed \SI{500}[\$] million of additional revenue per year,
and would continue to do so in the future~\cite{smith1992yield}.
In an example from Chilean retail, the authors of~\cite{bitran1998coordinating}
report an expected revenue improvement of \SIrange{7}{16}{\percent} after implementing
model-driven strategies.
For retailers with billions of pounds in revenues, small
improvements to their revenue-management processes can be worth millions
of pounds.
In addition unsold items add up to thousands of tonnes of waste per year, so
improving the control of demand for products is advantageous
for both retailers and the environment.

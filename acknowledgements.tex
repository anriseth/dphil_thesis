I would like to thank my supervisors Jeff Dewynne and Chris Farmer for
all the time they have devoted to working with me. They have helped me
understand other viewpoints of my research and how to communicate new
results. I have taken great pleasure in our frequent meetings and the
range of technical and everyday discussions.

My work is partially supported by the EPSRC Centre For Doctoral
Training in Industrially Focused Mathematical Modelling (EP/L015803/1)
in collaboration with dunnhumby Limited.
